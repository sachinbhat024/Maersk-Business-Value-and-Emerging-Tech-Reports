## Report 2: Business case on how Investment in Emerging Technology can create Business Value for Maersk

The implementation of **Green Logistics Optimisation Tool** will enable Maersk to significantly enhance their sustainability agenda in today’s world of intensified environmental awareness and regulatory pressures. Leveraging AI-driven analytics, this novel tool improves the efficiency of shipping routes, transportation modes, and optimises logistics operations with the main focus on reducing carbon emissions. Incorporating this technology will enable Maersk to comply with the strict global environmental standards while setting new benchmarks for the logistics industry. 

The implementation of Green Logistics Optimisation Tool offers Maersk a great business opportunity by directly catering to the growing market demand for environment friendly logistics solutions. It provides a strategic approach to augment operational efficiency, 
decrease costs by minimising fuel consumption, and greatly reduce the carbon footprint per shipment. It also aids in strengthening Maersk’s customer service by providing sustainable shipping options that increase client retention while also attracting business from environmentally-conscious organisations. The transparent sharing of data with suppliers and partners will pave way to stronger collaborations while aligning allied efforts for broader sustainability goals. 

## Report 3: Maersk applying Emerging Technology for Competitive Advantage 

**Proposed Business Use Case Brief with the Emerging Technology** 

**Business Opportunity/Problem**: While being a global leader in logistics and supply chain management 
Maersk faces challenges in optimising its extensive and complex 
operations. When combined with the dynamic nature of global trade, the 
sheer scale of Maersk’s logistics network leads to inefficiencies, poor 
management of assets, and high operational costs. Conventional methods 
of supervising and managing supply chain activities are not sufficient 
anymore to cater to these problems efficiently. 

**Emerging Technology: Digital Twins**: By creating virtual copies of processes, physical assets, and systems the 
Digital Twins technology proposes a promising solution. Providing deep 
insights into the performance and state of the resources, these digital 
counterparts enable the organisation to real-time simulation, supervision, 
and analysis. With the use of Digital Twins, Maersk will be able to attain 
substantial augmentation in their operational efficiency along with 
enhanced decision making.
